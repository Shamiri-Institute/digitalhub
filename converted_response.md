## 1. Fidelity Grade

Based on the provided rubric and my analysis, here are the scores for the session:

| Question # | Statement | Rating (1-7) | Justification |
| :--------- | :--------- | :----------: | :------------ |
| **1** | The group leader followed the study protocol and delivered the required content. | **3** | The facilitator did not adhere to several mandatory protocol elements. The explanation of confidentiality was incomplete; it missed the crucial jovial example about 'setting the school dorm on fire' and the specific condition for breaking it (danger to self/others), instead giving a generic doctor-patient analogy ('in cases that are too extreme'). Key therapeutic skills like Rephrasing, Connecting Between Students, and the 3-step Reflecting process were largely absent. While the session covered the 'Growth Mindset' topic, the execution lacked adherence to the specific techniques required by the protocol. |
| **2** | The group leader adhered to the specifications around the content delivered. | **4** | The facilitator addressed the main content topic of 'Growth Mindset' and 'Neuroplasticity'. They used the provided materials, having students read from the book (e.g., around 734s and 1176s). However, a disproportionate amount of time was spent on icebreakers (almost the first 7 minutes), which likely compromised the depth of the core content. The facilitator also read a large story themselves (around 1294s) rather than facilitating student discussion around it. Key discussions were not fully facilitated as per the protocol. |
| **3** | The group leader delivered the required content thoroughly. | **3** | The delivery of the core content felt rushed and superficial. The concept of neuroplasticity was defined, but the discussion was not deep. The facilitator primarily asked students to define terms or read passages, rather than exploring their personal experiences with the concepts thoroughly. The facilitator's prompt for growth stories (around 1480s) was good, but the follow-up discussions were brief and didn't explore the challenges and strategies in depth, with the facilitator doing most of the talking. |
| **4** | The group leader delivered the required content skillfully. | **5** | The facilitator's main strength is skillful delivery in terms of creating a warm and engaging atmosphere. The high `pitch_diversity` and energetic tone kept the session lively. They used self-disclosure effectively to model the growth mindset concept with a personal story about struggling with Physics (1392s). However, this skill in engagement did not translate to the skillful application of core therapeutic techniques like validation, juxtaposition, or connecting themes between students, which were significant misses. |
| **5** | The group leader delivered the required content clearly and accessibly. | **6** | The facilitator excelled at making the content clear and accessible. They broke down complex terms like 'neuroplasticity' into simple, relatable language ('your brain can grow and change if you want it to'). They used a mix of English and Swahili, which is appropriate for the context, and referenced culturally relevant figures (e.g., Mr. Beast, Obama) to illustrate points. The overall communication style was very age-appropriate and engaging for high school students. |
| **6** | The group leader did not add content from outside the protocol. | **7** | The facilitator did an excellent job of staying within protocol boundaries. There was no introduction of outside therapeutic content. The self-disclosure used was appropriate, directly relevant to the topic of 'Growth Mindset', and served as a model for the participants. They maintained a friendly but professional boundary throughout the session. |
| | **Overall Score** | **4.7/7** | The session was characterized by high energy and strong rapport-building, but low adherence to the specific therapeutic techniques of the protocol. The facilitator is skilled at engagement but needs significant training on core counseling skills and protocol structure. |

## 2. Qualitative Feedback

### Overall Summary

This session focused on introducing the concept of Growth Mindset. The facilitator began with a series of lengthy icebreakers that successfully created a positive and energetic atmosphere. The core content on growth mindset and neuroplasticity was introduced through readings from the manual and facilitator-led explanations. The highlight of the session was a segment where students were prompted to share their own 'growth stories', leading to two powerful personal disclosures. While the facilitator demonstrated excellent rapport-building skills and used self-disclosure effectively, there was a noticeable lack of adherence to core protocol techniques such as validation, rephrasing, and connecting themes between students. The session felt more like an engaging psychoeducational lecture than a facilitated group therapy session.

### Strengths

1. Excellent rapport-building and creation of a positive, energetic environment. The high `pitch_diversity` reflects their engaging and expressive vocal tone.

2. Effective use of self-disclosure to model vulnerability and the concept of a growth mindset (e.g., sharing their personal struggles with Physics).

3. Made complex psychological concepts like neuroplasticity accessible and relatable to adolescents using simple language and modern examples (e.g., Duolingo, Mr. Beast).

4. Successfully encouraged participants to share personal and meaningful growth stories, creating moments of genuine connection.

### Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement

1. **Protocol Adherence:** The mandatory explanation of confidentiality was not delivered according to the protocol. It lacked the specific harm example and was not framed jovially.

2. **Time Management:** Too much time was spent on icebreakers, leaving insufficient time for a thorough exploration of the session's core topic.

3. **Use of Therapeutic Skills:** Key skills were underutilized. There were missed opportunities for **Validation** (e.g., after a student shared a story of being bullied), **Rephrasing** (summarizing student contributions in their own words), and **Connecting Between Students** (linking the two growth stories about self-acceptance).

### Session Flow and Engagement

The session's pacing was uneven, with a very long and interactive icebreaker period followed by a more rushed, lecture-style content delivery. The `quick_exchange_ratio` is high, likely driven by the fast-paced games at the beginning. Participant engagement was high during the icebreakers but became more passive during the content section, where students were often asked to read aloud or listen to the facilitator. The facilitator dominated the speaking time, especially during the latter half of the session. The 'growth story' segment was the most therapeutically potent part of the session.

## 3. Flags for Behavior

* **Other:** A student shared a past experience of struggling with body image, being called names ('kande, wewe ni sindano'), feeling like a 'misfit', and dealing with anger issues in primary school which included physical altercations ('ningeslap them or nilichapa'). (Severity: Low, Timestamp: toward the end of the session)

## 4. Recommendations

1. **Practice the Confidentiality Script:** Rehearse the exact wording for the confidentiality explanation, including the jovial tone and the mandatory 'setting the dorm on fire' example to ensure this critical element is covered correctly in future sessions.

2. **Structure Session Time:** Allocate a strict time limit (e.g., 5-7 minutes) for icebreakers to ensure that the majority of the session is dedicated to the core protocol content. This will allow for deeper exploration rather than a superficial overview.

3. **Focus on One Skill Per Session:** In supervision, focus on mastering one core skill at a time. For the next session, the goal could be to practice **Validation**. For every student contribution, the facilitator should practice responding with a validating statement like, 'Wow, that sounds really tough. It makes sense that you would feel that way.'

4. **Implement 'Connecting' Questions:** After one student shares, actively practice connecting them to the group by asking questions like: 'Thank you for sharing that. Has anyone else had a similar experience with feeling judged?' or 'That story about self-acceptance reminds me of what [other student] shared earlier. It seems like this is a common theme for many of you.'
