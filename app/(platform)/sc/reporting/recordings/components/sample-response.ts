export const SAMPLE_MARKDOWN_FEEDBACK = `## 1. Fidelity Grade

Based on the provided rubric and my analysis, here are the scores for the session:

| Question # | Statement | Rating (1-7) | Justification |
| :--------- | :-------- | :----------: | :------------ |
| **1** | The group leader followed the study protocol and delivered the required content. | **1** | There was a complete departure from the protocol. The session was not a therapeutic group intervention but a high-level panel discussion with adult professionals about scaling mental health programs. None of the 11 core protocol elements (e.g., confidentiality explanation, validation, rephrasing) were present or applicable. |
| **2** | The group leader adhered to the specifications around the content delivered. | **1** | The content specifications of the Shamiri Intervention were not met. The discussion focused on policy, funding, and sustainability of interventions at a systems level, rather than the psychoeducational content (like gratitude or growth mindset) designed for adolescents. |
| **3** | The group leader delivered the required content thoroughly. | **1** | The required therapeutic content was not delivered at all, therefore it could not be delivered thoroughly. The session's content was entirely unrelated to the intervention's curriculum. |
| **4** | The group leader delivered the required content skillfully. | **1** | While the facilitator was a skillful panel moderator, they did not deliver any of the required therapeutic content. The score reflects the complete absence of skillful delivery of the intervention protocol's techniques (e.g., connecting students, using therapeutic silence, juxtaposition). |
| **5** | The group leader delivered the required content clearly and accessibly. | **1** | The language used was appropriate for a professional panel but was not the clear, accessible, and youth-focused content required by the protocol. The concepts discussed were abstract and policy-oriented, not the relatable therapeutic concepts for high school students. |
| **6** | The group leader did not add content from outside the protocol. | **1** | The entire session consisted of content from outside the protocol. The facilitator moderated a discussion on a topic completely different from the Shamiri intervention curriculum. This represents a 100% deviation from the prescribed content. |
| | **Overall Score** | **1.0/7** | Extremely low fidelity. This was not a Shamiri peer counseling session. It was a panel discussion with professionals on scaling mental health interventions. The recording does not align with the therapeutic protocol being evaluated, and therefore, fidelity could not be assessed. |

## 2. Qualitative Feedback

### Overall Summary

This session was a structured panel discussion, not a therapeutic group for adolescents. The facilitator acted as a moderator, guiding a conversation with several distinguished guests from government ministries and foundations. The topic was the strategic challenges and success factors for scaling evidence-based mental health interventions in Kenya. The conversation revolved around policy, funding, sustainability, and community co-design at a macro level. There was no interaction with youth participants and no delivery of the Shamiri intervention's psychoeducational content.

### Strengths

1. The facilitator demonstrated strong skills in moderating a professional panel discussion.

2. The facilitator asked relevant, open-ended questions to guide the panelists' contributions.

3. The facilitator managed the time and flow of the conversation effectively, ensuring all panelists had an opportunity to speak.

### Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement

1. The fundamental issue is the mismatch between the session type and the evaluation criteria. This recording is not a Shamiri group therapy session and cannot be used to evaluate fidelity to the intervention protocol.

2. No therapeutic skills from the protocol were demonstrated because the context was inappropriate for their use.

3. The session did not create a peer-counseling environment for adolescents as required by the protocol.

### Session Flow and Engagement

The session's flow was typical of a structured panel discussion, with the moderator posing questions and panelists providing detailed answers. The audio features, such as a low average speech gap and a high quick exchange ratio, reflect a fast-paced, professional dialogue rather than a reflective therapeutic session. Engagement was high among the adult panelists, but this was not the peer-to-peer engagement the Shamiri protocol aims to foster among adolescents.

## 3. Flags for Behavior

* No safety flags identified in this session.

## 4. Recommendations

1. Ensure that the recordings submitted for fidelity evaluation are actual Shamiri peer counseling sessions conducted with adolescents, not conference panels or other events.

2. This recording should not be used to assess the facilitator's competency in delivering the therapeutic intervention.

3. A new recording that aligns with the Shamiri Intervention Protocol is required to perform a meaningful fidelity assessment.`;
